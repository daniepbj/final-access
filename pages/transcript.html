        <p><strong>Male</strong> “Do you know how climate change can affect us in the future? Climate change is a
          set of disturbances caused by the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. These gases
          are mainly carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons”. </p>
        <p><strong>Female</strong> “Global warming forces alterations in the patterns of rains, droughts, cyclones
          and cold and hot waves. According to this expert, agriculture and livestock, two sectors that we depend on
          for food, will be deeply affected”. </p>
        <p><strong>Expert</strong> "It is influencing the increase in temperatures, both strong summer heat waves
          and increasingly temperate winters which may cause frost later and evidently these frosts can do extensive
          damage to crops ". </p>
        <p><strong>Male</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Female</strong> “It may seem like a contradiction, but agriculture and livestock also pollute and
          represent a third of greenhouse emissions, therefore, play a key role in finding a balance between respect
          for the environment and our own food security”. </p>
        <p><strong>Male</strong> “But how 1s climate change affecting the development of agriculture and
          livestock?”. </p>
        <p><strong>Female</strong>“The FAO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, has been
          blunt: climate change is already affecting food production and harvesting, as droughts and torrential
          rains are more common. Phenomena of this kind ruin crops. In addition, the rise of the level of the waters
          will salt and flood coastal lands that will be useless for their cultivation”.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Male</strong> “We should clarify that, on the one hand, agricultural tasks can contribute to the
          storage of carbon in soils and plants, which absorb C02 and remove it from the atmosphere. It is estimated
          that forests and agricultural land can eliminate 9% of total greenhouse gas emissions”.</p>
        <p><strong>Female</strong>“But the opposite may also occur, as agricultural activities release the carbon
          stored in the soil through harvesting, the drying up of wetlands, and deforestation”. </p>
        <p><strong>Male</strong>“In total, greenhouse gas em1ss10ns from agriculture, including crops, livestock,
          forestry and fisheries have almost doubled in the last 50 years and could continue to increase”. </p>
        <p><strong>Female</strong> “In this section, we want to highlight an anecdote: the bovine animals are the
          species responsible for the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions, around 65%. Cattle as a whole,
          accounts for a quarter of methane emissions”. </p>
        <p><strong>Male</strong>“Can you imagine a world without water? Surely you get an idea of how difficult life
          is without the so-called liquid element. Without water, it is impossible to grow crops. With climate
          change, essential foods such as wheat, rice and maize will be affected. This will increase the global
          population suffering from chronic hunger, which now exceeds 800 million people”. </p>
        <p><strong>Male (Continuation)</strong> “Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of all water consumed on Earth,
          a figure that reaches 95 percent in developing countries. The FAO predicts that water demand will continue
          to rise by 2050. If </p>
        <p><strong>Male</strong>climate change produces torrential rain and drought in traditional growing areas,
          how can we meet the needs of human consumption? The same will happen with livestock, how do we feed them
          ifpastures and water are scarce?”. </p>
        <p><strong>Female</strong>“Finding the solutions to tackle these problems is a challenge, because by the
          year 2050, a world population of 9.6 billion people must be fed. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions can
          also be achieved in agriculture and livestock with technological changes, improving varieties, growing
          procedures and increasing yield of crops”. </p>
        <p><strong>Male</strong>“A first step would be to grow the most suitable type for each climate and sell
          seasonal products to local merchants, to favor the local economy and reduce C02 emissions from transport.
          Consider that the natural resources that sustain agriculture, such as land and water, are increasingly
          scarce and are more threatened by the degradation of nature”. </p>
        <p><strong>Female</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Male(Continuation)</strong> “On the other hand, food production systems currently consume 30
          percent of the energy available around the world. Seventy percent of this energy is consumed when food has
          already left the farm, that 1s, m transportation, processing, packaging, storage and sale”. </p>
        <p><strong>Female</strong> “It is also vital to avoid wasting food, since a third of what we produce is lost
          or thrown away, and with 38 percent of the energy consumed in its production and marketing”.</p>
        <p><strong>Female</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Male</strong>“Agriculture and livestock are two sides of the same coin: victims and causes of
          climate change. We must achieve its sustainability, and this depends on the efforts of humanity. Care for
          land and livestock are essential for the future of many generations. It is a question of strengthening the
          local economy, of kilometer zero and the use of ecological products, that have followed the development
          process respectful with the environment”. </p>
